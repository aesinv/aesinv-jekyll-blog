# The Blog of Matt Bengston
This is the source for my blog, located at [aesinv.com](http://aesinv.com). It runs on [Jekyll][], a static-site generator, with added development functionality via [Gulp][].

## Dependencies
- [Bower][]: Front end dependency manager (full integration still WIP)
- [Gulp][]: Workflow automation and task management
- [Node.js][] / [NPM][]: JS Runtime for Gulp and Gulp dependency management

## Project Setup
- Make sure [Node.js][] and [NPM][] is installed locally
- Make sure you've gone through and followed the [Jekyll Installation Guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ "Jekyll Installation Guide"), and have [Ruby][] and [RubyGems][] installed on your machine
- Clone/fork project locally
    + `git clone <repo url> .`
- Ensure [Gulp][] is installed
    + `npm install -g gulp`
- Ensure [Bower][] is installed
    + `npm install -g bower`
- Install [NPM][] package and dependencies
    + `npm install`

## Project Workflow
#### `gulp build:assets`
Concatenates, minifies, and optimizes all site JavaScript, runs the [Jekyll][]-built stylesheet through an auto-prefixer and minifier, then optimizes all published images within the `/project/img/` directory.

#### `gulp serve`
Creates a local server via [Browsersync][], runs the [Jekyll][] build, runs the `build-assets` task, then watches for any changes within the `/project/` directory. Rebuilds necessary files and refreshes the [Browsersync][] server on changes.

#### `gulp deploy`
Runs the [Jekyll][] build with the production config file, then runs the `build-assets` task to build and optimize all site assets.

## Project Structure
```

## Hat Tips
- [Beno√Æt Boucart](http://blog.webbb.be/): Wrote an awesome article on using Jekyll with Gulp, which opened me up to the `child_process.spawn` method.
- Icons from the [Noun Project][]:
    + Category icon on post pages: Shai Rilov
    + Tags icon on post pages: factor[e] design initiative

## TODO
- ~~Create auto-deployment via git~~
- Add "pinned post" functionality (mostly for cars category, for my post engine resource guide)
- Add tag cloud of sorts to expandable sidebar
- Add social share function
