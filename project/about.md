Hey there! My name is **Matt Bengston**, and I'm a **web developer** and **gear head** based out of beautiful **Richmond, VA**.

I currently work as a Front End Developer at [ICF Interactive](http://icfi.com/interactive) and Webmaster/Developer for [Import Image Racing](http://importimageracing.com). I have a passion for innovative content delivery and efficient workflows that make developing more fun, and strive to build remarkable web experiences.

I've got experience with a multitude of platforms from WordPress to Magento in PHP land, and even Adobe CQ (AEM) in Java land. I constantly work towards improving task management and efficient workflows to make the development of incredibly dynamic sites easier and more fun.

I'm also a total car nut with a particular inclination for old Japanese cars. I currently drive around a 1989 Nissan Laurel C33 imported from Japan, and as a slightly-younger lad I competed in a Formula Drift ProAm series in Texas with my old [Nissan 350z race car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V21zVut6Gs4&list=PL8yuIfNT9Yzw8X9bPNmDFZY9x6flvqrwl).
