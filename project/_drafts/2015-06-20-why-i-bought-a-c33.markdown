excerpt: When my wife and I learned we had a baby on the way, a baby-mobile for me was a hot topic in our household. Normal people would probably go buy some crossover, SUV, or sedan; I decided to go buy an obscure 26 year old car from Japan.

Spending a lot of time on forums when I was first getting into cars, a commonality I noticed in a lot of for sale threads went along the lines of: _"Well, my wife and I have found out we're expecting our first child and so it's time to sell my car and get something more practical."_ Totally valid, but kind of a bummer; and something I used to think about before I even met my wife. Cars have been an inherit part of who I am ever since I was a little kid playing with my toy car collection and it's something that I hope to pass down to my future son, so I wouldn't want to toss that aside for a little extra trunk space so his stroller can have extra air around it

One thing I've learned in my short stint as a married car guy is that the second an automotive opportunity presents itself, you have to jump on it. **Especially** when your spouses favorite TV network is HGTV and a baby is going to be in the mix soon. Once we found out we were expecting, the baby-mobile topic came up a lot. It's going to no matter what if you've got a somewhat-unpractical car, and 9 times out of 10 it's going to end with you buying a new car. More often than not that car will be something newer, four doors, at least four seats, big airy cabin with lots of space in the back; the more practical and reliable the better. I didn't do that.

## You bought a what?
While searching around I kept in mind that I wanted to buy something practical but fun, and something I could use to _[enjoy car life](http://shirtstuckedin.com/)_ with my son; a car we could go on fun mountain pass drives and track days with. There were quite a few cars that fit the bill, but a unique opportunity arose to purchase a car fresh off the boat from japan. This is something I've wanted to do for years, but was never in a position to actually make it happen. This time I was in a position, and I wanted to jump on it.

In short, the only way you can legally purchase and legally register a car from overseas that was never sold here (outside of being in the military/airforce and bringing it back with you) is by waiting until the car is [25 years old](http://www.superstreetonline.com/features/1410-how-to-import-a-r32-nissan-skyline-gtr/). This really isn't too much of an issue due to the outstanding condition the majority of road-legal cars out in Japan, but what was an issue was I had no idea if there were any practical cars to choose from that were now legal. There's the standard stuff that the majority of car guys know about; Nissan Skylines, Nissan Silvias, Toyota Supras, kei cars but outside of that the majority of fun, cool sport sedans are relatively low key and not to much information is readily available for them.

Luckily, a friend of mine introduced me to a local importer/dealer that had already imported and sold tons of cool four doors, which gave me a chance to do some research on my options.  I wound up falling in love with a particular type of car, and next thing I knew I was the proud owner of one: A [sixth-generation Nissan Laurel](http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/HERITAGE/laurel_rb20.html), chassis code C33. It's a Club&dot;S model, was born in 1989, has 61,XXX miles on the clock and as far as I'm concerned its airy cabin full of early-90's brown-colored luxury is the absolute perfect baby-mobile.
