featurealt: My new (old) 1990 Nissan C33 Laurel.
excerpt: When I started looking around for a sedan, I started out with a list of about twelve cars. Ten of which were 10 years old or less, new, and reliable; the other two were 25 years old, rare, and imported from Japan. I went for one of the 25 year old imported cars.

## The Obvious Choice
I spent a good week or two going through my magical list of cars to attempt to widdle it down to a more manageable number, and one by one it got shorter and shorter. Some of them got knocked off due to reasons that would be considered by non-gear heads as legitimate, sensible reasons. Some of which were more ridiculous and would only be confirmed by fellow gear heads; particular ones that are fans of wasting as much money as possible on something like racing.

> "Too expensive to maintain."<br />
> "Heard horror stories of transmissions and differentials blowing up and being very expensive to replace."<br />
> "In the real world, really would not be a practical choice."<br />

All quite legitimate, sensible reasons. The other side of the spectrum, however...

> "Previously had 2 of a car that shares it's chassis, I know I'd get bored real fast. Like, REALLY fast."<br />
> "Desire to blow all my money on turbo swap way too strong. 10/10 would blow up."<br />
> "Too boring unless you spend a bunch on motor junk."<br />

All completely ridiculous reasons that only make any sense to someone who likes cars and poor decisions. Regardless, these legitimate and ridiculous reasons both knocked off countless cars from the list, leaving a couple solid options. Two of which stayed on indefinitely, while the rest of the cars got rejected for the exact same reason over and over again:

> "Would be really cool, but I know I'd regret not taking advantage of the opportunity to get one of the old imported classics."

Utterly ridiculous? Yes. Worth it? Yes.

## Cars Stuck in Time
After I struck all of the sensible and responsible options off of my list, it was time to find the _mature sport sedan_ for me. I already knew where I was going to go to handle all of the logistics, [Japanese Classics LLC](http://www.japaneseclassicsllc.com/), but I had to figure out which of my options was going to be my target: 4 door Nissan R32 Skyline, Nissan C33 Laurel, or Nissan A31 Cefiro. All ridiculous, all legal, yet all so desireable.

## Third Headline
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight javascript %}
module.exports = function repeat(operation, num) {
    if (num <= 0) return;
    operation();
    return repeat(operation, --num);
}
{% endhighlight %}
