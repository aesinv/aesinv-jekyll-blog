excerpt: For the past few months I've been absolutely straining at the leash to finally make an actual game and fulfill my childhood fantasy of being a game developer. I decided to finally just bite the bullet and go for it.

To quell my thirst for game development I've been occasionally playing around in [Unity 5][1] over the past few months; just getting familiar the editor and playing around with UnityScript so when the time was right I could really get the ball rolling on getting a game developed as soon as I came up with an idea.

That was it! A roll-a-ball game, _Super Monkey Ball_ inspired however with an added gimmick: you control the ball by tilting the phone every which way. It was perfect! Nothing so crazy that it would take forever to really create, but just experimental enough to be a real learning experience. I began researching immediately.

After about 6 refactors I finally had a working and pleasant to use gyroscope-based player movement implementation completed, and the hype was absolutely real. I immediately began showing it to some coworkers to get their feedback on how it felt to them as fresh eyes on the implementation, and after some small chats to a couple people about the inner workings of the implementation I wound up getting asked to do a talk/demo on the things I've learned from working on it.
